    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a complete implementation of the Wiener attack on RSA, a cryptanalytic technique that targets RSA keys with small private exponents. The attack was first discovered by Michael J. Wiener in 1990 and exploits the properties of continued fractions to efficiently recover the private key when certain conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA is one of the most widely used public key cryptosystems, but it can become vulnerable if its parameters are not chosen correctly. Specifically, if the private exponent d is too small relative to the modulus N, the Wiener attack can break the encryption in polynomial time."

    "The success of Wiener's attack is rooted in the theory of continued fractions. When d is very small (compared to n), the fraction e/n (or more precisely, e/φ(n)) is well approximated by one of its convergents. This convergent gives us a candidate fraction k/d that satisfies the equation ed – k·φ(n) = 1, enabling the recovery of φ(n) and eventually the factors of n.\n",

    "You might consider extending the notebook to:\n",

    "1. Generate RSA keys with small d to demonstrate the vulnerability.\n",
